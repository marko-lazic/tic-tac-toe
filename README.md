We are going to deploy on devnet.

Here is your deployment checklist ðŸš€

1. Run anchor build. Your program keypair is now in target/deploy. Keep this keypair secret. You can reuse it on all clusters.
2. Run anchor keys list to display the keypair's public key and copy it into your declare_id! macro at the top of lib.rs.
3. Run anchor build again. This step is necessary to include the new program id in the binary.
4. Change the provider.cluster variable in Anchor.toml to devnet.
5. Run anchor deploy
6. Run anchor test
